## Project Overview

**Project Name**: SafeVax - Vaccine Distribution Simulation System  
**Course**: Operating Systems  
**Team Members**: Abel [Last Name], [Partner Name]  
**AI Assistant**: Claude (Anthropic)

## Development Timeline

### Session 1: Initial Project Planning

**Date**: December 10, 2024

**Tasks Completed**:

- Reviewed project requirements and grading criteria
- Defined project scope and objectives
- Created initial project documentation

**Claude's Role**:

- Helped interpret project requirements
- Suggested applying OS scheduling algorithms to vaccine distribution
- Provided structure for project documentation

**Prompts Used**:

1. "make me a project md, make sure it's only the required stuff and in python"
2. "instead of web interface, lets do gui. i think by deploying the teacher meant post to github"

**Outputs Generated**:

- `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Complete project specification
- System architecture diagram
- Algorithm descriptions and verification examples

---

### Session 2: Implementation Phase

**Date**: December 10, 2024

**Tasks Completed**:

- Implemented complete vaccine distribution simulation system
- Integrated Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance
- Built Tkinter-based GUI with real-time updates
- Implemented thread-safe resource allocation

**Team's Implementation**:

- Created `Vaccine distribution simulation.py` with all core functionality
- ResourceManager with lock-based synchronization
- Hospital threads with random resource requests
- GUI with global resource tracking and hospital status display
- System logging for allocation decisions

## AI Contributions by Category

### 1. Documentation (60% of project grade)

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: GUI vs Web Interface

**Claude's Suggestion**: Use GUI (Tkinter/PyQt) instead of web hosting  
**Rationale**: Simpler deployment via GitHub, focus on OS concepts rather than web technologies  
**Team Decision**: Accepted ✅

### Decision 2: Scheduling Algorithms

**Claude's Suggestion**: Implement FCFS, Priority, and Round Robin  
**Rationale**: Cover different OS scheduling paradigms, allow comparison  
**Team Decision**: Accepted ✅

### Decision 3: Priority Calculation

**Claude's Formula**: `priority = (density × 0.3) + (cases × 0.5) + (at_risk × 0.2)`  
**Rationale**: Weight current cases highest, balance with demographics  
**Team Decision**: To be evaluated during implementation

---

## Code Implementation Status

### Generated by Claude

- ❌ None - only pseudocode and documentation provided

### Implemented by Team

- [✅] `Vaccine distribution simulation.py` - Complete SafeVax implementation including:
  - ResourceManager class (Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance)
  - Hospital class (threading-based concurrent processes)
  - SafeVaxGUI (Tkinter-based graphical interface)
  - Thread-safe resource allocation with locks
  - Real-time GUI updates via queue-based communication
  - Safe state checking and provisional allocation/rollback

---

## Verification & Testing

### Algorithm Verification (Provided by Claude)

**Toy Example Scenario**:

- 500 vaccines, 3 hospitals
- Requests: H1=200, H2=150, H3=300
- Expected outcomes documented for each algorithm

### Testing Plan (To Be Implemented)

- [ ] Unit tests for each scheduling algorithm
- [ ] Concurrency stress tests
- [ ] Fairness metric calculations
- [ ] GUI interaction tests

---

## Learning Outcomes

### OS Concepts Applied

1. **Process Scheduling**: Hospital requests as processes, vaccines as CPU time
2. **Resource Allocation**: Shared vaccine pool with competing demands
3. **Synchronization**: Thread-safe allocation using locks
4. **Concurrency**: Multiple simultaneous hospital requests
5. **Deadlock Prevention**: Resource ordering strategies

### Skills Developed

- Translating abstract OS concepts to real-world problems
- Designing verification test cases
- Technical documentation writing
- System architecture design

---

## Limitations & Disclaimers

**What Claude Did**:

- Provided documentation structure and content
- Suggested algorithms and approaches
- Created pseudocode and examples
- Offered design guidance

**What Claude Did NOT Do**:

- Write actual Python implementation code
- Make final design decisions (team decisions)
- Test or verify working code
- Create GUI layouts or visuals

**Human Responsibilities**:

- All actual code implementation
- Testing and debugging
- GUI design and user experience
- Performance analysis and results
- Video demonstration
- Final report writing

---

## Ethical Considerations

1. **Transparency**: This document openly acknowledges all AI assistance
2. **Academic Integrity**: No code was generated; only guidance provided
3. **Learning Focus**: AI used to understand concepts, not bypass learning
4. **Team Collaboration**: AI assists but doesn't replace partner work

---

## References & Resources

**Claude's Suggestions**:

- Python threading documentation for concurrency
- Tkinter tutorial for GUI basics
- Matplotlib for visualization
- OS textbook scheduling algorithm chapters

---

## Future Sessions

### Session 3: Testing & Refinement (Upcoming)

- Date: TBD
- Tasks: Testing, performance analysis, execution results
- Planned activities: Run multiple simulation scenarios, analyze fairness metrics

### Session 4: Documentation Finalization (Upcoming)

- Date: TBD
- Tasks: Final report writing, conclusions, video demonstration
- Planned activities: Complete report sections, record demo video
